This is a C# project for Wiimote Gyroscopic Mouse with WiimoteLib.  
This software enables you to use your Wiimote as an air mouse. Watch this video to see how this works.

Before you run this application, connect the motion plus into your Wiimote and get ready for the bluetooth connection.  
Then launch the application and push the "CONNECT" button.  

Here is the function mapping from Wiimote to mouse/keyboard operations:  
"A" -> mouse left button  
"B"(press) -> enable the gyroscope  
"B"(release) -> disable the gyroscope  
"-" -> Back Space key  
"+" -> Enter key  
"home" -> Windows key  
"1" -> mouse right button  
"2" -> ALT key  

You can reprogram the combination freely with your own preference.
